    progress
        - add edges
            - edges should appear below the nodes, to be fixed
        - add color property to nodes & edges
            - key of edge_dict is a frozenset (unordered & hashable)
        - algorithms.py
            - ed for editor, in place of nx.graph
            - returns math.inf (instead of error) when the graph is not connected

    ideas(?)
        - show labels
        - write a piece of code that generates colors
